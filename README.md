# Fixaj-3in1-ESP32-Communication
This is PlatfromIO project where Flixaj 3in1 package was used to create a wireless communication between two ESP32 via LoRa 433MHz modules

Make sure that you are using the library provided in lib_dev ="librarry itself", otherwise, there could be some problems. 

In here I added the Master and Slave files with both library managment and raw UART managment. Fell free to use either of them for your project.
DISCLAIMER!
If for some reason transmittion doesn't work you might wanna change the pin configurations on your pcb. For more info check this website(https://fixaj.com/3in1-esp-pcb/)
